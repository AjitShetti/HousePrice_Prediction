# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, furnishing status, road access, and more.  
It follows a modular structure — with clean separation for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal is to build a regression model that can estimate the price of a house using real-world housing data.  
The pipeline supports multiple algorithms including:
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  
- XGBoost  

The model with the highest R² score is automatically saved for future predictions.
